# cub3D
cub3D is a simple minimalist ray caster engine.
<br>
It's the project targeted for game development and rendering during
**Core Curriculum** at *42 Schools*.

## Building and usage
To build the project, simply type:
```
make
```
Please note that this project uses *MiniLibX*,
and so **libX11** development files may be required for the build process.
<br>
<br>
To run, use:
```
./cub3D <map>
```
Maps are available in the **maps/** directory.

## One more thing...
This is the last project written in C during the Core Curriculum,
meaning that **Norminette will not be enforced after finishing this one.**
<br>
<br>
Just hang in there, you're almost done with suffering!
